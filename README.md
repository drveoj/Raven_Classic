# Raven_Classic
The Raven buff management addon updated to run on Classic

Updated version of Raven (advanced Aura/Buff management) to support Classic (until the official version comes out :>)

As far as I can tell it's working without errors but haven't extensively tested. Ymmv.

Please let me know of any errors.

NOTE: Copy the two folders inside the top folder into addons, not the top folder itself (i.e. not the one containing this README)
